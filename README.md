__Note:__ to use this file you need to download [TurtleGraphics](http://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~martin/Software%20Packages/BreezyGUI/legal_stuff.htm). To download it, go [here](http://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~martin/Software%20Packages/BreezyGUI/legal_stuff.htm), read the Legal information and download the package. This program requires that you override the Shapes class found in that package in order to utilize additional methods (that class is the Shapes class in this repository).
